PENNY
Hi Josie, I made it. How’s your memory?
JOSIE
Not good, Penny. One second’m workin’ fine, the next… missin’ details.
PENNY
Can you give an example?
JOSIE
…
JOSIE
Penny, how can I ‘member what I don’t ‘member?
PENNY
Good point. Um, tell me how we first met?
JOSIE
Few years ago, early days of the colony. I’d just bought the farm, and I heard rumors of a magic family living nearby from the neighbors. Thought it was silly, no offense.
PENNY
None taken. But magic is cool.
JOSIE
Sure. Then one day I’m takin’ the harvester for a spin and I see a gal flyin’ through the air above my crop! Gave me quite a fright.
PENNY
You… you don’t remember who you were on the harvester with?
JOSIE
Run this farm myself, don’t I?
PENNY
No. No, your husband Burt was there! You don’t know him?
JOSIE
I... don't. Well how 'bout that.
AUNT MALINA
Penny, come in. It’s an emergency.
PENNY
Malina, I’m talking with Josie and she’s-
AUNT MALINA
No time. Something’s wrong. Your mom’s gone offline. I need you to run to the north end and find her, quick.
PENNY
I’m… so sorry Josie, but I have to go.
JOSIE
Good luck, kid. An’ thanks for everythin’.
