MOM
Alright Penny, systems check.
PENNY
Come on, Mom! I’m a big witch, we don’t need to go through this every time.
AUNT MALINA
She’s right, Artemisia. You’re smothering her.
PENNY
See, Aunt Malina agrees!
MOM
I don’t want to hear it. Safety is always important, hon. Suit, read out.
PENNY’S SUIT
PRESS W,A,S,D TO MOVE. PRESS SPACE TO JUMP. PRESS LEFT CLICK TO CAST A GRAVITY WELL AND RIGHT CLICK TO ACTIVATE.
MOM
Sounds good. Mask sealed?
PENNY
Mask sealed. Who needs help today?
MOM
There have been reports of memory loss all over the city. I’m going to talk to the patients at the north end, while you… go talk to Josie, down the street.
PENNY
MOOOM! Come on!
MOM
Moon Witches don’t complain, hon. Be grateful I'm even letting you participate.
PENNY
Mom, the moon is totally safe, besides the unfinished atmosphere. But... okay, I've gotta start somewhere I guess.
AUNT MALINA
Psst, Penny. I may or may not have left you some potions on your route. Some gifts to keep your strength up.
PENNY
Noted. Love you both!
MALINA & MOM

PENNY
Alright, I’m off!
